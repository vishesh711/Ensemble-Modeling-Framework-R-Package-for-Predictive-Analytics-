\title{Pre-screen Predictors Based on Correlation}
\usage{
pre_screen_predictors_corr(X, y, top_k = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{top_k}{An integer specifying the number of top predictors to return based on highest correlation.
Default is 10.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing both the predictors and the response variable.}

\item{response_column}{A string specifying the name of the response variable column in the data frame.}
}
\value{
A character vector of the names of the top_k predictors with the highest absolute correlations to the response variable.
}
\description{
This function screens predictors based on the absolute value of their correlation with the response variable.
It is useful for preliminary feature selection where the goal is to identify predictors that have the strongest
linear relationships with the response. The function calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient for each predictor
with the response and returns the names of the top_k predictors with the highest absolute correlations.
}
\examples{
# Assume 'df' is a data frame with several predictors and a response variable named 'response'
top_predictors <- pre_screen_predictors_corr(df, "response", top_k = 5)
