# Ensemble-Modeling-Framework-R-Package-for-Predictive-Analytics

**Ensemble-Modeling-Framework-R-Package-for-Predictive-Analytics** is an R package designed to provide advanced ensemble learning techniques and preprocessing tools for predictive modeling. This package implements various regression and classification algorithms, along with utilities for data cleaning and feature selection, optimized for high-dimensional datasets.

---

## Features

- **Ensemble Learning Algorithms**:
  - **Bagging**: Reduces variance by averaging predictions from multiple models.
  - **Random Forest**: Extends bagging with decision trees for improved accuracy and interpretability.
  - **Lasso Regression**: Shrinks coefficients to enhance feature selection.
  - **Ridge Regression**: Penalizes large coefficients to address multicollinearity.
  - **Elastic Net**: Combines Lasso and Ridge for flexible regularization.
  - **Logistic Regression**: Implements binary classification with interpretability.

- **Preprocessing Utilities**:
  - **Feature Screening**: Filters predictors based on correlation thresholds.
  - **Data Transformation**: Automates scaling, normalization, and missing value imputation.
  
- **Advanced Ensemble Techniques**:
  - **Blending and Stacking**: Combines multiple models to enhance prediction robustness.

## Installation

To install the package, use the following commands in R:

```R
# Install devtools if not already installed
install.packages("devtools")

# Install simpleEnsembleGroup6 from GitHub
devtools::install_github("your-github-username/simpleEnsembleGroup6")
```

---

## Usage

### Example 1: Random Forest Model
```R
library(simpleEnsembleGroup6)

# Load your data
data <- your_dataset

# Preprocess the data
clean_data <- pre_process(data)

# Fit a Random Forest model
model <- random_forest_model(clean_data, target = "response_variable")

# Predict
predictions <- predict(model, newdata = test_data)
```

### Example 2: Lasso Regression
```R
# Fit a Lasso Regression model
lasso_model <- lasso_regression(clean_data, target = "response_variable")

# Evaluate the model
summary(lasso_model)
```
