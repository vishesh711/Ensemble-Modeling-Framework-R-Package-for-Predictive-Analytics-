## Bagging with simpleEnsembleGroup6

### Overview

Bagging, or bootstrap aggregating, is an ensemble learning method that reduces variance and helps to avoid overfitting. It involves generating multiple bootstrap samples from the original data, fitting a model on each of these samples, and then averaging the predictions. The bagging function in simpleEnsembleGroup6 automates this process and provides a straightforward way to apply bagging to any predictive model.

### Getting Started

#### Loading the Package

Ensure that simpleEnsembleGroup6 is loaded along with any specific modeling packages required by the model_func you intend to use:

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(simpleEnsembleGroup6)
# Assume you are using a modeling function from another package, e.g., glmnet
library(glmnet)
```

### Data Preparation

#### Example Dataset

For illustration, let's use the mtcars dataset. We will predict the mpg (miles per gallon) based on other car attributes.

```{r}
# Load the mtcars dataset
data(mtcars)
# Prepare predictors and response
X <- mtcars[, -which(names(mtcars) == "mpg")]
y <- mtcars$mpg
```

### Using the bagging Function

The bagging function simplifies the process of applying bagging to a specified model function.

#### Function Parameters

-   *X*: Matrix or dataframe of predictors.
-   *y*: Vector of the response variable.
-   *n_bootstrap*: Number of bootstrap samples to generate.
-   *model_func*: The function to fit the model, taking y and X as inputs.
-   *sample_size*: The size of each bootstrap sample.
-   *n_features_subset*: Number of features to randomly select for each bootstrap sample.

#### Function Usage

Hereâ€™s how to use the function with a generic linear model function as an example:

```{r}
# Define a simple linear model function for demonstration
simple_lm <- function(y, X) {
  lm(y ~ ., data = as.data.frame(cbind(X, y)))
}

# Running the bagging function
results <- bagging(X, y, n_bootstrap = 100, model_func = simple_lm)
```

### Results and Interpretation

After running the function, you will receive a list containing the averaged predictions and variable importance scores.

```{r}
# Print the averaged predictions
print(results$predictions)

# Print variable importance scores
print(results$variable_importance)
```

### Details of the Process

1.  *Bootstrap Samples*: Generates samples from the original data with replacement.
2.  *Feature Selection*: Randomly selects a subset of features for each model to reduce variance and increase model robustness.
3.  *Model Fitting*: Fits the specified model on each bootstrap sample.
4.  *Prediction Aggregation*: Averages predictions from all models to get the final prediction for each observation.
5.  *Variable Importance*: Calculates how frequently each feature is selected across all bootstrap samples, providing insights into feature relevance.

### Conclusion

The bagging function in simpleEnsembleGroup6 provides an efficient way to implement bagging for any modeling function, enhancing prediction stability and accuracy. This method is particularly useful in scenarios with high variance among model predictions and is a robust tool for improving model performance.
