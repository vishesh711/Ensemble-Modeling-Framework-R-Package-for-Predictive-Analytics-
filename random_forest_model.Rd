\usage{

\value{
A randomForest model object.
#' @details
This function fits a Random Forest model to the provided data. Random Forest is an ensemble learning
method that constructs a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the mode (classification)
or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. It can be used for both classification and
regression tasks.
}
\description{
This function fits a Random Forest model to the data for either classification or regression.
}
\examples{
# Fit a Random Forest model for regression
data(mtcars)
X <- mtcars[, -which(names(mtcars) == "mpg")]  # Predictors
y <- mtcars$mpg  # Response variable
model <- random_forest(X, y)
}
