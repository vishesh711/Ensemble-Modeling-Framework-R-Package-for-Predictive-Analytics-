## Ridge Regression with simpleEnsembleGroup6

### Overview

Ridge regression is a technique used to analyze multiple regression data that suffer from multicollinearity (independent variables are highly correlated). By adding a degree of bias to the regression estimates, ridge regression reduces the standard errors. It is a method of estimating the coefficients of multiple-regression models in scenarios where linearly independent variables are highly correlated.

### Getting Started

#### Installing and Loading the Package

Before we begin, ensure that simpleEnsembleGroup6 and glmnet are installed and loaded, as glmnet is used for performing ridge regression:

```{r}
# Install glmnet if it's not already installed
if (!require(glmnet)) install.packages("glmnet", dependencies = TRUE)

# Load necessary libraries
library(simpleEnsembleGroup6)
library(glmnet)
```

### Data Preparation

#### The Dataset

For illustration, we will use the mtcars dataset, which includes various attributes of cars. We aim to predict the mpg (miles per gallon) using attributes that might reflect the car's performance and design.

```{r}
# Load the mtcars dataset
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
```

#### Preprocessing Steps

Data preprocessing is a crucial step to ensure the data is clean and suitable for modeling:

```{r}
# Handling missing values if any
mtcars <- na.omit(mtcars)

# It is common to standardize predictors in ridge regression
mtcars$disp <- scale(mtcars$disp)
mtcars$hp <- scale(mtcars$hp)
mtcars$wt <- scale(mtcars$wt)

# Define the response and predictors
y <- mtcars$mpg
X <- as.matrix(mtcars[, c("disp", "hp", "wt")])
```

### Fitting a Ridge Regression Model

The ridge_regression function is designed to handle the nuances of fitting a ridge model, including selecting the type of response variable and handling the regularization parameter.

#### Function Usage

```{r}
# Fitting the ridge regression model
model <- ridge_regression(y, X)
```

### Results and Interpretation

Reviewing the output of the ridge regression model is essential for understanding how well the model performs and which variables are significant.

```{r}
# Display the model coefficients
print(coef(model))
```

Coefficients in ridge regression are shrunken towards zero, which helps in reducing model complexity and multicollinearity.

### Model Tuning

Choosing the right value for the regularization parameter, lambda, is critical. This parameter controls the amount of shrinkage:

```{r}
# Optimal lambda selection through cross-validation
cv_model <- cv.glmnet(X, y, alpha = 0)
plot(cv_model)
best_lambda <- cv_model$lambda.min
cat("Best lambda:", best_lambda)

# Refitting the model with the best lambda
best_model <- ridge_regression(y, X, lambda = best_lambda)
```

### Conclusion

This vignette has illustrated how to utilize the ridge_regression function within the simpleEnsembleGroup6 package to fit a ridge regression model. It included explanations of the method, detailed steps for data preparation, model fitting, result interpretation, and parameter tuning.
